DuplicateSelections
===================

I wrote and use this plugin as an alternative to copy and pasting.

First, you can use this command to duplicate the current line (or lines).

Another common use case is when you need to copy some small bit of text, like a variable or method name.

Select the text to copy, then `cmd+click` to place an empty cursor, then run this command to insert the selected text at the cursor position.

This can be extended to multiple selections: if you have an equal number of selections and cursors, this command will place each selection at the corresponding cursor location.

Or, you can select some text and place *multiple* empty cursors, and the selection will be inserted at all the cursor locations.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
    ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
    ],
    ```
1. And,
    change it to the following, i.e.,
    put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
    ],
    ```
    * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
      you will not install this forked version of the package,
      but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
    go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    search for **`DuplicateSelections`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
